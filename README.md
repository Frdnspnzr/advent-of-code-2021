# Advent of Code 2021

Here's my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). My personal rules are:

1. I'm not going for highscores. That's way too much work. When do these puzzles even go live anyway?
2. Let's see how far I get before I completely forget about it. Looking forward to solving puzzle no. 25 in 2027.
3. No cheating in the repository. Everything I thought would be a valid solution has to be commited before I enter my solution.
4. I'm not going for optimization, fancy solutions or new technologies. Just plain old testing how fast I can throw something together.
